    "## Pipeline Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We extended the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by implementing a comprehensive multi-step pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Named Entity Recognition Classification (NERC)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Tool: Spacy (`en_core_web_sm` model)\n",
    "-   Evaluation: Larger and alternative architectures were tested but yielded negligible performance improvements.\n",
    "-   Optimized Entity Tags:\n",
    "    -   `PERSON`\n",
    "    -   `GPE`\n",
    "    -   `LOC`\n",
    "    -   `NORP`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Enhanced Wikipedia Page Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Context: Focused on the 2022 U.S. midterm elections dataset.\n",
    "-   Method:\n",
    "    -   Augmented entity extraction from step 1 by incorporating search queries related to elections (e.g., district, governor race).\n",
    "    -   Applied regex query _(case-insensitive)_:\n",
    "        ```regex\n",
    "        won the (.*? in the 2022)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Wikipedia Content Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Metric: Cosine similarity with respect to the question.\n",
    "-   Retention: Only kept the top `MAX_TEXTS_TO_KEEP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Vector Database Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Tool: `langchain`'s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.\n",
    "-   Optimization:\n",
    "    -   Tested various `chunk_size` values.\n",
    "    -   Best result achieved with `chunk_size=500`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Prompting the Large Language Model (LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Approaches:\n",
    "    1. No-RAG: Direct LLM prompting using only the question and options.\n",
    "    2. RAG: Added relevant Wikipedia context from the vector database to the prompt.\n",
    "-   Optimization: Domain-specific prompt engineering for both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
