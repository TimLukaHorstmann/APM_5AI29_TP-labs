# 📚 Language Models and Structured Data Labs

This repository contains the lab exercises for the course **Language Models and Structured Data (APM_5AI29_TP)** taught by [Mehwish Alam](https://sites.google.com/view/mehwish-alam/home) at [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/). The course explores both traditional and novel applications of language models, including their use with structured data such as graphs, databases, and tables. 

The labs cover key techniques such as **prompt engineering**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and advanced applications where **language models extend beyond standard NLP tasks**.

## 📂 Lab Structure
